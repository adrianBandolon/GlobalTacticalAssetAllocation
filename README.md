# Portfolio Rebalance

+ I wrote this `*.rmd*` for personal use and experimentation. 
+ This is my interpretation of Meb Faber's **Global Tactical Asset Allocation**. ([The white paper here.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=962461)) I'm not sure as to it's applicability now since it has been some time (about 10 years or more) since the white paper was first written and some years since it was last update (in 2013).
+ It has been so long since I first wrote this code that I don't know who to credit for writing the ranking functions I used.
+ The `*.rmd` file is self contained. It downloads data from **yahoo finance**, runs them through the ranking functions and outputs a `*.pdf*` file with the top five funds based on their ranking for the past month and for the past three months. Included in the output is the monthly charts for the funds in the top five.
